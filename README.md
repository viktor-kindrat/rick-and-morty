Welcome to the Rick and Morty Fan Page! This project is a labor of love that I created to celebrate the incredible animated TV series, Rick and Morty. Immerse yourself in the captivating world of the show through this engaging web application that I developed.

## Features

- **Characters**: Explore a comprehensive list of all the memorable characters from the Rick and Morty series. Enjoy a seamless browsing experience with pagination, displaying 20 character cards per page. Convenient filters allow you to narrow down the characters based on their species, status, and gender. Each character card includes captivating images (when available) and additional intriguing details. Clicking on a character card reveals a popup window with in-depth character information.

- **Episodes**: Dive into the vast collection of episodes that make Rick and Morty unforgettable. The episode page presents episodes in a user-friendly table format for easy navigation and discovery. Utilize filters to search for episodes by name and explore your favorite moments. Efficient pagination displays 20 episodes per page.

- **Locations**: Embark on a journey through the various locations featured in the Rick and Morty universe. The locations page presents information in a convenient table format, making exploration effortless. Utilize filters to search for specific locations by name, type, and dimension.

- **My Watch List**: Personalize your Rick and Morty viewing experience by creating a watch list tailored to your preferences. Add episodes you wish to watch later by entering the details into the input field. Your watch list items are securely stored in local storage, ensuring persistence across page reloads. Effortlessly manage your list by removing items with a single click and marking episodes as complete using the checkbox feature.

## APIs and Libraries

To provide a seamless experience, I integrated the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#introduction) to fetch the necessary data. The project utilizes React.js, a versatile JavaScript library, to build the application's core functionality. For styling and intuitive components, I used Material UI, a popular UI library that enhances the user experience.
